# Book-Search-Engine

## Description:
Take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## User Story:
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

# Note On Deployment:

`id_Token persists in returning "undefined" creating issues with savedBooks page. This issue was troubleshot for days and even with the help of ASKBCS senior student assistance. It is my belief that legacy versions of Dependencies are creating issues within the server itself. I have even migrated to an earlier version of Node which resolved digitial envelope routine support during build and deployment.`
